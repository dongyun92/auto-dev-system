# ATC Dashboard RWSL System Development History

## Session: 2025-06-26

### 1. Primary Request and Intent:
- Fix React infinite loop error causing "Maximum update depth exceeded" warning in RadarDisplay.tsx:1170
- Resolve compilation errors (TS2552, TS2304, TS2339) after attempting to fix the infinite loop
- Fix "Unable to preventDefault inside passive event listener" error when using mouse wheel
- Update runway 32R heading from incorrect values to official chart value of 323°
- Double the takeoff position recognition range from 500m to 1000m for RWSL system
- Add visualization for takeoff position recognition ranges on the radar display
- Clarify what the green dashed rectangles represent on the display
- Verify if the takeoff recognition range is actually needed for RWSL and how it differs from takeoff holding area

### 2. Key Technical Concepts:
- React useEffect dependency array management to prevent infinite loops
- Passive event listeners and preventDefault compatibility in modern browsers
- Canvas-based radar display rendering with real-time updates
- RWSL (Runway Status Lights) system components: REL, THL, RIL
- Runway naming conventions (runway 32 = 320° nominal, but RKSS uses 323°)
- Aircraft takeoff detection logic using position, heading, speed, and acceleration
- GPS loss compensation system using dead reckoning
- Spatial indexing optimization using 500m grid cells
- Three different takeoff-related ranges: holding area, recognition range, THL activation range

### 3. Files and Code Sections:
- **/Users/dykim/dev/auto-dev-system/modules/atc-dashboard/src/components/RadarDisplay.tsx**
  - Main radar display component implementing RWSL logic
  - Fixed infinite loop by removing rwslLines from useEffect dependencies (line 1237)
  - Separated runway occupancy tracking to dedicated useEffect with interval (lines 1209-1268):
  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    if (aircraft.length === 0) return;
    const intervalId = setInterval(() => {
      setRunwayOccupancyTime(prev => {
        const newOccupancy = new Map(prev);
        // ... tracking logic
        return newOccupancy;
      });
    }, 100);
    return () => clearInterval(intervalId);
  }, [aircraft, localRunways, systemHealthStatus.gpsHealth]);
  ```
  - Implemented native wheel event listener with passive: false (lines 1289-1306):
  ```typescript
  useEffect(() => {
    const canvas = canvasRef.current;
    if (!canvas) return;
    const handleWheelEvent = (event: WheelEvent) => {
      event.preventDefault();
      const newScale = scale * (event.deltaY > 0 ? 0.9 : 1.1);
      setScale(Math.max(0.1, Math.min(20, newScale)));
    };
    canvas.addEventListener('wheel', handleWheelEvent, { passive: false });
    return () => {
      canvas.removeEventListener('wheel', handleWheelEvent);
    };
  }, [scale]);
  ```
  - Updated runway headings: 320° → 323° (8 locations)
  - Increased takeoff recognition range: 500m → 1000m (lines 942, 949, 442)
  - Added takeoff position range visualization (lines 1979-2030)

- **/Users/dykim/dev/auto-dev-system/docs/RWSL_ALGORITHM.md**
  - Reviewed RWSL algorithm documentation
  - Confirmed REL activation logic for takeoff aircraft

- **/Users/dykim/dev/auto-dev-system/docs/RWSL_TAKEOFF_POSITIONS.md**
  - Verified THL activation range of 100m
  - Confirmed takeoff position definitions for each runway

### 4. Problem Solving:
- **Infinite loop**: Caused by setRunwayOccupancyTime inside updateRWSLAutomation callback with circular dependencies. Solved by extracting to separate useEffect with interval-based updates
- **Compilation errors**: Functions were scoped inside updateRWSLAutomation. Solved by using calculateDistanceHelper directly and calculating runway center from centerline endpoints
- **Passive event listener**: React's synthetic onWheel doesn't support preventDefault. Solved by using native addEventListener with {passive: false} option
- **Runway heading confusion**: Initially changed to 315°, then 320°, finally confirmed 323° from official charts

### 5. Pending Tasks:
- None - all requested tasks completed

### 6. Current Work:
Creating history documentation file following compact_custom_prompt.md structure to preserve session context for future reference. This is in response to user's request to "summarize and create xxx_history.md" based on the compact_custom_prompt.md template.

### 7. Optional Next Step:
None - user indicated session is ending with "다음 세션에서 널 만나러갈게" (I'll meet you in the next session)

## Technical Details for Future Reference

### RWSL System Architecture
1. **Takeoff Holding Area** (Green dashed rectangle)
   - Size: 100m × 60m
   - Purpose: Visual representation of physical holding area
   - Implementation: showTakeoffPositions toggle

2. **Takeoff Recognition Range** (Blue/Green circles)
   - Radius: 1000m (increased from 500m)
   - Purpose: Used in RWSL REL logic to detect takeoff aircraft
   - Colors: Blue for 14L/32R, Green for 14R/32L

3. **THL Activation Range**
   - Radius: 100m
   - Purpose: Takeoff Hold Lights activation proximity

### Runway Configuration
- **14L/32R**: Primary runway
  - 14L heading: 143°
  - 32R heading: 323° (official chart value)
- **14R/32L**: Secondary runway
  - 14R heading: 143°
  - 32L heading: 323°

### Performance Optimizations Applied
- Spatial indexing with 500m grid cells
- 100ms interval for runway occupancy tracking
- Canvas rendering optimizations
- Selective aircraft filtering for RWSL calculations
